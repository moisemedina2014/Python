Inspired by Disney/Pixar's animated film, Cars 2: The Video Game lets you rev up your engine and join Lightning McQueen, Holly Shiftwell, Miles Axelrod and friends in a high-speed race around the globe. If you train hard enough, you might just make it as a special agent for C.H.R.O.M.E. (Command Headquarters for Recon Operations & Motorized Espionage) and get to tackle dangerous missions as an international spy. Use your daredevil driving skills in action-packed combat races and see if you can become the fastest car in the world!
