Creators of the award-winning PixelJunk series for PLAYSTATION®3 (PS3™) system and PlayStation®Network (PSN) brings one of the industry’s most popular and addictive tower defense games to the PSP system with the newest addition to the PixelJunk series, PixelJunk™ Monsters Deluxe. Inspired by the popular and addictive “tower defense” genre, PixelJunk™ Monsters Deluxe brings not only all the content from the original PS3 PSN version to the world of the handheld, but as an added bonus, PixelJunk™ Monsters Deluxe also features newly released PixelJunk™ Encore as well.

In PixelJunk™ Monsters Deluxe, the player controls a defender-of-the-forest character in a lush 2D environment. The player’s goal is to strategically defend the pathway to his homebase from an onslaught of various threatening monsters. In between waves of monster attacks, the player scrambles to reinforce his defenses by collecting gold coins and jewels from fallen enemies to finance new towers and research deadlier weapons.

The game features a new island with more than 10 stages, new enemies, music tracks and special bonus features. With two new unique towers available, players can enjoy all the original Monster stages with fresh new gameplay.
